# Sudoku
This is a Python project that replicates the classic Sudoku puzzle game and also finds solutions for it. The project is developed using Python programming language and can be executed in IDEs like IDLE or PyCharm. The project uses two essential modules, namely Pygame and Tkinter, which must be pre-installed in the system.  

The project is designed to simulate a Sudoku puzzle game where a user can interactively input the numbers and check their validity in real-time. The program generates a Sudoku puzzle, and the user is required to solve it by entering the numbers in the correct positions. The program checks the input numbers' validity and displays an error message if the user enters an invalid number.  

Additionally, the project also provides a solution to the Sudoku puzzle, making it easier for the user to learn the game's mechanics and strategies. The program employs various algorithms and logical techniques to find the solution to the puzzle. The program's algorithm is designed to be efficient and optimized to provide the solution in the shortest possible time.  

In conclusion, Sudoku is a Python project designed to replicate the Sudoku puzzle game and provide solutions to it. The project is easy to install and execute and is suitable for Python beginners who want to learn the language's basics and get hands-on experience in developing Python programs.
